# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Fixed

- Style lookups by name never matched on Civil 3D 2027, so a requested style
  was silently replaced by the drawing's first one: `create_layout` with style
  "Design Profile" got "Existing Ground Profile", and `view_create` with style
  "Profile View" warned the style was missing. Civil 3D 2027's `StyleBase`
  declares a set-only `Name` that hides the readable base-class `Name`, so the
  reflective name read returned null for every style, label set and band set.
  Names are now read through the documented `DBObject.Name`, and the
  reflection boundary resolves a readable (or writable) declaration when a
  derived class hides one. A style, label set or band set name that does not
  exist is now `CIVIL3D.INVALID_INPUT` listing the available names instead of
  a silent substitution. No name still means the drawing's first one, except
  the section view band set and group plot style lookups, which pass Civil
  3D's default (a null id), and the profile view band set lookup, which uses
  the first band set only where the caller asks for it (`view_create` does).
  `create_layout` / `create_from_surface` now report the style and layer
  applied. Affects every `LookupUtils` style lookup (alignment, profile,
  surface, alignment/profile label set, profile view style and band set,
  parcel style, parcel area label style, section view style and band set,
  group plot style) and the name reads in the label and pipe-network style
  lookups.
- `civil3d_profile view_create` always failed on Civil 3D 2027 ("ProfileView.Create
  returned null"): the plugin probed `ProfileView.Create` by reflection with
  argument orders that do not exist. It now calls the typed
  `Create(alignmentId, insertPosition, name, bandSetId, styleId)` overload,
  falling back to the drawing's first profile view style and band set when none
  is named. When the drawing has only one of the two, the view is created with
  Civil 3D's defaults, the one that exists is applied to it, and a warning
  names the one that was missing; a named style or band set that cannot be
  applied, or a view that cannot be given the requested name, fails with
  `CIVIL3D.INVALID_INPUT` and nothing is created. New optional `layer`; the
  result reports name, handle, layer, style and band set.
- The profile view band-set lookup read `ProfileViewBandSetStyles` from the
  label-set styles root, where it does not exist, so it always returned a null
  id (`view_band_set` imported nothing). It now reads `Styles.ProfileViewBandSetStyles`.
- A requested layer that did not exist was silently replaced by the current
  layer (e.g. `create_layout layer:"C-ROAD-DES"` landed on layer 0). Missing
  layers are now created; an invalid layer name is `CIVIL3D.INVALID_INPUT`.
  Applies to every create path that takes `layer` (profiles, alignments,
  offset alignments, polylines, text, lines, profile views).
- `civil3d_profile check_k_values` computed K with A as a decimal grade
  difference (0.028) instead of percent (2.8) — a 280 ft curve reported
  K ≈ 9,980 — and always used a metric table, so 50 (mph) required sag 9 /
  crest 4. K is now L / (100·|g2−g1|), checked against the AASHTO
  stopping-sight-distance design K tables in mph (ft/%) or km/h (m/%). New
  optional `speedUnits` (`mph` | `km/h`) defaults from the drawing's length
  unit; speeds between rows use the next higher row (and say so); speeds
  outside the table are `CIVIL3D.INVALID_INPUT`. Per curve it now returns
  grades in percent, A in percent, K, required K, start/end and PVI station.
  A profile with no vertical curves reports `allPass: false` with a warning,
  since nothing was checked.
- `civil3d_profile get` reported symmetric parabolas as `asymmetric_parabola`
  ("parabolasymmetric" contains "asymmetric"); they are now
  `symmetric_parabola`. The response schema still accepts the old `parabola`.
- `civil3d_drawing` `settings` failed response validation on every drawing:
  the plugin reports `defaultStyles.corridor` as `null` unconditionally (Civil
  3D exposes no corridor style collection) and the schema rejected `null`. The
  five `defaultStyles` fields are now `string | null`, with regression tests.
- `docs:check` and `version:check` reported generated files as stale on any
  Windows clone with `core.autocrlf=true`; comparisons now ignore CRLF/LF.

### Added

- Civil 3D 2027 build path: `scripts/gather-refs-2027.ps1` stages the six
  managed references (spread across three folders in a 2027 install) and
  `scripts/build-2027.ps1` builds with a `net10.0-windows` override — Civil 3D
  2027's assemblies target .NET 10 — without changing the 2026 default.
- `scripts/install-bundle.ps1` deploys the plugin as an ApplicationPlugins
  bundle, which auto-loads under the default `SECURELOAD=1` policy that rejects
  Startup Suite entries outside `TRUSTEDPATHS`.
- With no document open, drawing-dependent requests hung and wedged the
  plugin's execution gate; they now fail fast with `CIVIL3D.NO_DRAWING`, and
  `civil3d_drawing new` works from zero documents.
### Added

- `civil3d_plot` domain tool (plugin `PlotCommands.cs`): `list_layouts`,
  `list_page_setups`, `list_plotters` (read-only, never approval-gated) and
  `plot_layouts_to_pdf` / `publish_sheet_set` (approval-gated `export`). Plots
  drive `-PLOT` / `-PUBLISH` with `BACKGROUNDPLOT=0` instead of the PlotEngine,
  which live testing found crash-prone from a command context; every answer is
  validated up front, output goes through `FileBoundary` (export roots, `.pdf`,
  directory chain locked while the plotter writes, `overwrite` defaults to
  false), and success is only reported for a non-empty PDF written by the run.
  Both output actions can run as `civil3d_job` operations
  (`plot_layouts_to_pdf`, `publish_sheet_set`) via `asJob: true`. Verified
  live against Civil 3D 2027; `asJob` plotting has not been run live.
- `CivilExecution.ExecuteCommandSequenceAsync` for host work that issues
  AutoCAD commands; it keeps the `CIVIL3D.NO_DRAWING` check and the
  drawing-identity check but opens no transaction around the command.
### Added

- Read-only geometry reads, written to support a Civil 3D-Revit bridge. None
  of these is approval-gated (`query`/`inspect`, `safeForRetry`):
  - `getSurfaceTinVertices` (`civil3d_surface get_tin_vertices`): the vertices
    of a TIN surface's visible triangles (or a grid surface's visible points),
    optionally clipped to a plan polygon. Over `maxPoints` (default 50,000,
    hard cap 100,000) they are decimated deterministically: sorted by X then Y,
    with an even stride. Coordinates are rounded to 6 decimals to keep the
    largest response near 6 MB. TIN volume surfaces are rejected clearly.
  - `getParcelGeometry` (`civil3d_parcel get_geometry`): real parcel boundary
    from the typed curve API (base curve, then `GetGeCurve`, then `Explode`)
    with line/arc segments, bulges, a densified polygon, perimeter and area
    computed including arcs. Parcels with holes return the outer loop only.
    `reportParcels` still uses its reflection path.
  - `getDrawingUnits` (`civil3d_drawing units`): raw INSUNITS and its name, a
    `lengthUnit` that keeps `USSurveyFeet` distinct from `Feet`, metres per
    unit, the Civil 3D drawing unit settings (Feet/Meters and the
    imperial-to-metric foot), angular units, and a consistency warning when
    INSUNITS and Civil 3D disagree.
  - `getPipeNetwork`/`getPipe` pipes gain `startPoint`, `endPoint`,
    `startInvert`, `endInvert`, `startCrown`, `endCrown`, `innerDiameter`,
    `outerDiameter`, `innerHeight`, `outerHeight`, `wallThickness`,
    `crossSectionalShape` and `length2d` (additive; inverts are centreline
    minus inner height / 2).
  - `getDrawingInfo` and `getCoordinateSystemInfo` gain an additive
    `lengthUnit`; `linearUnits` keeps its old values.
  - Host-independent `BridgeMath.cs` (arcs, bulge areas, chaining,
    point-in-polygon, stride decimation, unit resolution) with an offline
    harness, `npm run test:bridge-math`. Verified live against Civil 3D 2027.

### Fixed

- `getPipeNetwork` (`civil3d_pipe get`) failed with CivilException "Retrieve
  attribute failed" on networks whose style, parts list, or reference
  surface/alignment attributes are unset (seen on the Civil 3D 2027 Pipe
  Networks-3 tutorial drawing), although each pipe and structure read fine on
  its own. Those network attributes, and part-family-specific pipe attributes,
  are now read defensively and reported as `null`.
- The host executor rethrew captured exceptions with `throw ex`, which dropped
  the original stack from the plugin log; it now uses `ExceptionDispatchInfo`.

## v1.2.1 — 2026-07-14

### Production readiness

- Added a self-contained Claude Desktop MCPB package, a byte-identical legacy
  DXT compatibility artifact, installer configuration, checksum generation, and
  official manifest validation through `npm run package:claude`.
- Added a compact 33-tool default MCP surface while keeping 216 manifest-backed
  canonical and alias routes available internally; set
  `CIVIL3D_ENABLE_TOOL_ALIASES=true` to expose the full 218-tool MCP surface.
- Added first-class MCP output schemas, structured content, annotations,
  resources, progress notifications, and report-resource retrieval.
- Added parameter-bound, drawing-bound approval receipts, bounded serialized
  host execution, disconnect cancellation, idempotency, and stable errors.
- Added bounded background jobs for publishing, imports, corridor rebuilds, and
  bulk QC, with terminal retention and cancellation telemetry.
- Added liveness, readiness, plugin, queue, and version endpoints on the local
  HTTP bridge at port 3000.
- Added rotating native plugin logs with file-health and last-error telemetry.
- Added CI, generated tool documentation, manifest/dispatcher parity, package
  inspection, startup smoke, and opt-in live Civil 3D host validation.
- Removed tracked Autodesk assemblies; Release builds resolve licensed Civil 3D
  2026 references through `Civil3DReferencesPath`.

### Live validation

- Validated plugin 1.2.1.0 against Civil 3D 2026 on port 8080.
- Validated the spawned stdio MCP client, HTTP registration and routing,
  approvals, concurrency, document switching, create/undo/delete, temporary
  TIN-volume rollback, job cancellation/completion, and response limits.

### AI CoPilot Plugin (C#)

**Command routing (all 150 categories):**
- `IsMcpDirectCommand()` — routes `civil3d_*` and `create_cogo_point` to MCP async handler
- `IsHydrologyCommand()` — routes hydrology commands to async MCP → CAD draw pipeline
- `CommandRouter.Execute()` — synchronous CAD transaction handler for 14 draw command types
- `HandleMcpDirectCommandAsync()` — async MCP caller with formatted JObject result display

**Hydrology integration:**
- `HydrologyDrawer.cs` — draws flow paths (cyan), watershed boundaries (yellow), outlet markers (red)
- `McpClient.cs` — typed async methods for all 5 hydrology tools with result model classes
- Sequential workflow support: `lastHydroOutlet` chains `FindLowPoint` → `DelineateWatershed`

**AI providers supported:** Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic

---

### Integration Tests

- 13 test files, **372 tests**, all passing
- End-to-end workflow tests covering alignment → surface → corridor → profile pipeline
- Hydrology workflow tests covering flow path → low point → watershed → catchment → runoff

---

### Bug Fixes

- **JFS-15**: Fixed structural C# compile error — hydrology methods were accidentally placed outside the `McpClient` class body
- **JFS-15**: Made `ExecuteMcpToolAsync` public (was private) to enable direct MCP command routing

---

### Known Limitations

- Civil 3D API calls require an active drawing session — no headless mode
- Hydrology delineation uses grid sampling (not DEM-optimized); large surfaces may be slow
- C# plugin targets .NET Framework 4.8 (AutoCAD/Civil 3D requirement)
